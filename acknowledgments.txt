Acknowledgments

I used ChatGPT as a study partner to clarify concepts, check errors, and simplify code while completing this project. 
Conversations focused on understanding portfolio construction, covariance matrices, maximum return/minimum risk portfolios, 
efficient frontiers, and stability checks. The tool acted as a tutor/debugging assistant, not as a replacement for my work.

For transparency, I am including links to the transcripts of these interactions:

1. ChatGPT guidance: [https://chatgpt.com/share/68b211ab-0e80-8007-8a77-505c3a145044]
2. Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjv9yYpvYc8]

These resources document the support I received and ensure compliance with the class generative AI policy.
